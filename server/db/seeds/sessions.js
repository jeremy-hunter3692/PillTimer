Then once you can play them with no mistakes you can combine them.',

The scales are coming together but make sure their thumb tucks under quick enough, particularly on the Melodic minor. The pieces are sounding really great, very musical just needs some more practise time practising slowly to get the notes off by heart so they can concentrate on the phrasing.',
